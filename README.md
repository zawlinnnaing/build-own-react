# Build your own React.js

A simple implementation of React.js for learning purposes. This project is based on the [Build your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) tutorial by Rodrigo Pombo.

This implementation supports `function component` and includes two hooks:
- `useState`
- `useEffect`

You can find React.js implementation in [simple-react](./src/simple-react/) directory.

## Local setup

- Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

- Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Update [main.tsx](./src/main.tsx) to see the changes.
